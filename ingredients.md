INGREDIENTS
FOR THE YELLOW CAKE
3 cups cake flour
2 cups sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 sticks unsalted butter, softened
4 large eggs
1 cup (240g) buttermilk â€” **if you do not have buttermilk see note below
1 Tablespoon (12g) vanilla extract

FOR THE PINEAPPLE & CREAM FILLING:
1 small box instant vanilla pudding
2 cups heavy cream or whipping cream (not a whipped topping such as Cool Whip)
1  can crushed pineapple, DRAINED. If you want to add pineapple to the top of the cake, 
 reserve 1/3 cup

 FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING:
2 sticks (1 cup) (226 g) unsalted butter, let it sit out approximately 10 minutes. It should feel very cool to the touch.
2 (8oz) packages cream cheese (total weight 452g) I use full fat cream cheese. Using reduced fat or 
the spreadable cream cheese will cause the frosting to be too soft. Soften very slightly.
2 teaspoons (8 g) vanilla extract.
1/2 teaspoon salt (2g) optional - it will cut the sweetness, popcorn salt is best to use because it is fine and dissolves faster
6 to 6 1/2 cups (690g to 747g) powdered sugar.
