INSTRUCTIONS - Main Recipe 

PINEAPPLE CAKE !!

FOR THE YELLOW CAKE
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour three 8x2 inch round cake pans. Place a piece of parchment cut to the size of the pan in the bottom of each.

Put the first 5 ingredients into the bowl of your mixer. Mix on low speed for at least 30 seconds to combine.
Add the softened butter (cut into pieces) mix on low speed just until it looks like coarse sand. The dry ingredients will be moistened/coated by the butter and will stick to together if you press some between two fingers. Don't over-mix or it will turn into a large dough-like ball.
Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing until blended. 
Add the vanilla to the 1 cup buttermilk. With the mixer on lowest speed gradually pour into the mixer. Increase the speed to #2 or # 3 (on a KitchenAid mixer). Mix for 2 minutes. Batter will be fluffy and smooth. If you are using a hand mixer rather than a stand mixer, you will need to mix a bit longer.
   Divide batter evenly between your three prepared (8 inch) pans.
Bake at 325 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and turn out of pans. 

FOR THE PINEAPPLE AND CREAM FILLING:
Stir together the pudding mix and whipping cream. You are using the whipping cream to make the pudding, rather than milk. The mixture will become very thick.
We prefer to use a hand mixer to whip the mixture until fluffy (if you do not have a mixer, you can do this with a whisk by hand). Fold in crushed, drained, pineapple until it is a spreadable consistency.

FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING:
Cut the butter into slices and add to the bowl of your mixer. Beat on low to medium speed until the butter is softened and smooth.
Cut the cold cream cheese into pieces and add to the butter, beating at low to medium speed until incorporated. If you are using a hand mixer you may need to soften the cream cheese a bit more.
Add the vanilla. Gradually add the powdered sugar beating on low speed until blended.
Increase mixing speed and beat until fluffy. Don't over beat.
This frosting will pipe best if used while still chilled. You can make it in advance, refrigerate and when ready to use let it soften slightly (do not microwave) and remix.
Will frost a 3 layer 8 or 9 inch cake.
